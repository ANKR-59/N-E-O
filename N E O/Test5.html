               <h2>The N E O Basement</h2>
               <p>Living on the surface is harmful.<br>
Indeed, humanity has ceased to evolve.<br>
It is even in constant decline.<br>
The main cause of this regression
is the failed system running the society.<br>
But there is still a solution.<br>
We invite you to join the N E O community.<br>
N E O was born in 2006 after the acquisition of a building
underground that can accommodate up to a thousand people.<br>
There is no place on the surface that is not
controlled by this faulty system.<br>
The principle of N E O is to get out of the system
by isolating itself below the surface.<br>
Like ants, N E O is a gigantic
underground complex similar to an anthill.<br>
We have set up a hierarchical system
well thought out allowing N E O to manage itself.<br>
<br>
All creative and manual activities
such as art, music, etc.<br>
Are produced by artificial computer intelligences.<br>
Giving free rein to spiritual research and
to the intellectual development of the members of N E O.<br>
<br>
The management of the technical and electronic system is
also managed by artificial intelligence.<br>
The members of N E O do not have any tasks to do.<br>
<br>
There are no timetables.<br>
The constraint of the body clock imposed by the sun,
time, day or night is non-existent in the enclosure of N E O.<br>
Allowing each member to wake up his clock
natural and to live in its timeline.<br>
<br>
Once you have entered the seint of N E O you can no longer detach yourself from it.<br>
A slight minority of members having expressed a desire
to leave N E O were diagnosed as having 
mental disorders due to the sudden change in lifestyle.<br>
They were treated by experienced psychologists from
N E O and are now better than ever.</p>
<p>Here are 2 testimonials:</p>

<p>Cheryl Mccann</p>
<p>"After a treatment over several months the results are phenomenal.<br>
I managed to forget why I wanted to leave.<br>
I don't even remember how I got here it's great.<br>
I know I would never live a better life than with N E O. "</p>

<p>Jarrod Storey</p>
<p>"I thought I wanted to go but it was a mistake on my part.<br>
Psychologists told me I felt bad about the disturbances
of my schedules.<br>
Infact they were right!<br>
It's so simple, I just had to stop sleeping. "</p>
<p>An undisclosed system has been put in place allowing N E O
to self-manage in food.<br>
Electric energy is produced at the surface from
wind turbines owned by N E O.<br>
Water is an inexhaustible network thanks to a
purification plant belonging to N E O.</p>
<p>By joining us, you will be able to escape the pressure
of the current global system.<br>
You will be able to live a self-managing life without having to complete tasks.<br>
Thanks to all this time saved you will be able to dedicate your life to
work on the mind and awakening spiritual awareness
and intellectual.</p>
